# newickFormatReader.py
# Ran Libeskind-Hadas, October 2013
# Newick file reader and parser

# Uses BioPython's Phylo package to read and parse a newick tree with internal
# node names specified.  Specifically, the input is of the form
# (LeftTree, RightTree) RootName
# LeftTree and RightTree are themselves newick trees and RootName is the
# name given to the root node.

# All node names (internal and tips) must be non-numeric!

# Returns a dictionary representation of the tree where
# keys are strings that are the names of edges and values are 4-tuples
# of strings of the form:
# (topVertex, bottomVertex, leftEdgeName, rightEdgeName)
