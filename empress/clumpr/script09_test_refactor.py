'''
Test the correct of the current implementation of maximum distance reconciliation.
We do this by assuming that the DP algorithm generates a valid reconciliation graph,
then we use the diamater algorithm to find the max distance (diameter) among the 
reconciliation trees in that reconciliation graph. We then compare the max distance
which is calculated by the algorithm with the max distance that is computed by 
enumerating all the reconciliation trees in the graph, finding the pairwise distance
of each.
